# [Better Journal](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/preferences.php?tab=mousehunt-improved-settings#mousehunt-improved-settings-better-better-journal)

Gives your journal a modern, streamlined look and adds powerful options to make it easier to read, browse, and understand your hunting history.

## Features

- **Modern Journal UI**: Transforms the journal into a cleaner, more visually appealing timeline of your hunts and events.
- **Condensed Date & Time**: Makes date and time smaller and attaches them to relevant entries (like tournament points, unstable charm procs, etc.) for a less cluttered look.
- **Scrollable Gift Entries**: Gift claim and return entries are now scrollable with a maximum height, so they never take over your whole journal.
- **Improved Colors**: Refines the colors for various journal entries to make important information stand out.
- **Condensed Progress Log**: Progress logs are displayed in a more compact, readable format.
- **Simplified Entries**: Rewrites and simplifies many journal entries for clarity and ease of reading.
- **Clickable Mouse Images**: Clicking a mouse image in the journal now opens the full mouse view, not just the image.

## Options

- **Journal styles**: Choose from different journal UI and entry styles for a personalized look.
- **Journal text replacements**: Make journal text clearer and more concise with smart replacements.
- **Show loot icons**: Display small icons next to loot entries for quick visual reference.
- **Show loot icons (minimal)**: Show icons only for select loot items, for a cleaner look.
- **Show loot as a list**: Display loot as a list instead of inline text for easier reading.
- **Show gold and points icons**: Add icons next to gold and points amounts in the journal.
- **Unique item colors (Map clues, Ful'Mina's gifts, etc.)**: Highlight special items with unique colors in the journal.
- **Show hunt type on hover**: Hover over an entry to see the hunt type (e.g., trap, map, event).
- **Journal History**: Save and browse your journal history beyond the default page limit, letting you look back further than the standard game allows.
- **Show full mouse images**: Display full mouse images in journal entries instead of smaller thumbnails.
