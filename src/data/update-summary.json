  "summary": "Hello Hunters! This release has some big changes behind the scenes to address some feedback from the Hitgrab team. This means there have been some changes to the Location Dashboard refreshing and FLRT Helper. Even though they now require some manual input, I think it's actually a bit more user-friendly. Better Maps Sorted tab and other map functionality should be working again as well.",
